# Clean-My-Desk

## About

Are you the kind of person that plays management simulators, but your real life is a mess? Do you want the satisfaction of cleaning without actually doing it? Well this is the game for you! Clean My Desk is a silly take on procrastination and the broken-physics games we all know and ironically love, in which you try and fail to clean my desk, redecorate my desk, or perhaps you just really want to play a Katamari Damacy rip-off (on my desk)!

Clean My Desk is an action party game developed in collaboration with the Georgia Tech Video Game Development Club.
